DEMel web portal
=====================

The **Diccionario del Español Medieval electrónico (DEMel)** is a semantically pre-structured and lemmatized database
dedicated to the Medieval Spanish.

The DEMel web portal is currently hosted at: <https://demel.uni-rostock.de>.

It is based on the digitized archive of the Diccionario del Español Medieval (DEM), which was discontinued at the end 
of 2007 for financial reasons. With more than 600 literary and non-literary works or collections of texts and documents 
as sources, the material represents the Spanish vocabulary from the 10th to the beginning of the 15th century. 
In total, the database contains about 650,000 attestations of more than 31,000 lemmas.

The project is funded by the *German Research Foundation* (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) with the project number 
[282533776](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/282533776).

The implementation of web application started in 2018.  
The relaunch of version 2.0 occured in May 2023.

On this Github repository we plan to release stable milestones of the source code for the web portal.
